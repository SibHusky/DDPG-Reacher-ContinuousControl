# DDPG-Reacher-ContinuousControl
Agent for solving the Unity "Reacher" Environment

## Introduction
This is all about a Reinforcement Learning problem. A double-jointed must move its hand to the goal location and keep it there. For each step the agent's hand is in the goal location a reward of +0.1 is earned.
To solve the environment the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.
